## Functionality

Users can quickly take and save notes, all saved notes are organized and displayed on the left column, allowing users to review them easily. If you no longer desire a particular note, I was able to complete the "Bonus" and add a delete note feature. Notes are stored on the server in a JSON file. This ensures that they remain accessible even after the user exits or restarts the application.
